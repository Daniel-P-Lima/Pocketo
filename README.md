sail artisan serve          # PHP server
sail artisan queue:listen   # Queue worker
npm run dev                 # Vite dev server (port 5173)
```

- All amounts are stored in **centavos** (integer) to avoid floating-point precision issues.
- The app locale is `pt_BR` (Brazilian Portuguese).
- Sessions, cache, and queues all use the database driver by default.
